## I have used whatever technology on this website:

## Waht is the purpose of the building this website?
The purpose of creating a news portal website is to provide a platform for disseminating timely and relevant information to a wide audience. It serves as a centralized source for news articles, updates, and various topics of interest. The website can aim to inform, educate, and engage users on current events, entertainment, sports, and other news categories. Additionally, a well-designed news portal can attract a diverse audience, build a community, and generate revenue through advertisements or subscription models.

## 5 Features of my project

- My website features a premium subscription system. Upon visiting the homepage, users encounter a modal after 10 seconds, guiding them to the subscription page. The website offers three subscription plans like 1 minute, 5 days, 10 days. for users to choose from. Once a user subscribes, they gain access to a premium, ad-free experience on the article pages.
- My website incorporates an admin dashboard that enables administrators to manage articles. Admins have the ability to decline, delete, or approve articles. Additionally, they can designate certain articles as premium. If an article is not approved by the admin, it remains inaccessible to users. This ensures that only approved and authorized content is visible on the website.
- The website is equipped with an admin dashboard that allows administrators to add publishers. Users have the ability to post articles and after submission, the articles go through an approval process by the administrator. Once approved, articles are visible on the website, ensuring a controlled and curated content experience.
- My website admin dashboard has a dynamic presentation of publisher statistics. Administrators can visualize the distribution of each publisher's articles through a pie chart, displaying each publisher's percentage contribution to the overall content. Additionally, a bar chart provides insight into visitor statistics for each article title, allowing administrators to gauge the popularity of individual articles. These graphical representations offer a comprehensive overview of content engagement and contributor performance.
- The admin functionality on my website extends to the capability of appointing new administrators. In the admin dashboard's user section, I have implemented pagination for improved navigation and efficiency. Additionally, I have applied pagination to the admin dashboard's all articles pages, ensuring a streamlined and organized presentation of content for enhanced user experience.
